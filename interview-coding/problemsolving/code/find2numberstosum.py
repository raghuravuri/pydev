''' given list of numbers find two numbers in the list whose sum equals to a sum value provided
  Input - List of numbers
      - Sum number to match with
  Output - Null if none matches
           two numbers and their index when sum matches 
           
  	- Given list of numbers, find combination of two numbers that equal to the sum given
	- [1,4,8,20,10] and sum is 5

	1. Come up with algorithm to solve the problem
	2. Demonstrate understanding of the problem
	3. Come up with initial working solution
	4. Revise for performance in different iterations
	5. Gives ability to test the candidate on performance notation
	6. Once a good performing solution is arrived at, implement the same in language of choice (Python?)
